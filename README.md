UpShot
======

![](https://raw.github.com/fwenzel/upshot/master/upshot.png)


# NOTE: As of March 2017, Dropbox has removed the public folder feature permanently, which breaks UpShot. There are discussions in [Issue #77](https://github.com/fwenzel/upshot/issues/77) on how to proceed, but for now, UpShot cannot function as expected because of this Dropbox feature change.

UpShot is an automatic screen shot uploader for OS X, written in Python.

For sharing, UpShot uses Dropbox's Public folder, giving you maximum control over what you share.

**For more information and to download UpShot, visit the [UpShot website][upshot].** If you want to contribute to UpShot or check out its source code, read on.

Features
--------
The basic workflow is this:

* UpShot listens to a new screenshot being created with OS X's default screenshot function.
* It moves that screenshot to your public Dropbox folder.
* It copies that public Dropbox URL to your clipboard.

Other features currently include:

* Custom domain name support (some "assembly" required)
* randomized filenames
* (optional) scaledown of retina-sized screenshots


Contributing
------------
UpShot is an open source project. [Issues / pull requests][issues], feedback, feature requests, â€¦, are greatly appreciated!

[issues]: https://github.com/fwenzel/upshot/issues


Compiling it
------------
UpShot uses a [fabric][fabric] script for build and maintenance tasks:

1. Create a [virtualenv][virtualenv].
2. ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. ``fab build``

This will build an app package in the directory ``dist``. You can execute it from there. If you want to see console output, start it via ``fab run`` instead.

[virtualenv]: http://www.virtualenv.org/


Configuration
-------------
The latest version has a configuration screen, but not everything is configurable yet. For a full list, check out ``upshot.py`` for constants. You can override all those in a (new) file ``settings_local.py``.
